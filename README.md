Visualizing Corona infection data

This project showcases how to analyze and generate graphs based on the official WHO data  in both C and Java. The decision to implement this project in both C and Java allows for a comparison of procedural (C) and object-oriented (Java) programming approaches.

This repository is divided into two main directories:

<ul>
    <li>`c_version`: Contains the implementation of the project in C.</li>
    <li>`java_version`: Contains the implementation of the project in Java.</li>
</ul>

Each directory has its own dedicated README.md providing specific instructions for that particular implementation.
